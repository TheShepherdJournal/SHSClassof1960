On August 26, 2017, twenty four former classmates from the Shepherd High School class of 1960 gathered for their 57 year class reunion. The class reunion was held inside the Maple Room starting at 1 p.m.

The tables and serving table were all still being arranged as attendees began to arrive. Former classmates greeted each other, some seeing a familiar face from long ago and some catching up with current friends or distant neighbors.

Photos and copies of the *Blue Jay Notes* were on display.
